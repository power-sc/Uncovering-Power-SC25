# Uncovering Power Consumption Variability in Production HPC Systems

This repository provides the artifact for the SC'25 paper titled:

**"Uncovering Power Consumption Variability in Production HPC Systems through Application and Node-Level Empirical Analysis"**

The artifact includes all scripts and resources necessary to reproduce the figures and results from our paper, which investigates job-level and node-level power consumption variability in a production HPC system.

---

## Overview

This work presents an empirical analysis of power consumption variability in a real-world HPC system ranked 11th on the TOP500 list. Our analysis focuses on:

- Temporal factors (month, day, time-of-day)
- Node characteristics (architecture, allocation scale)
- Application behavior (configuration, user-defined options, exit status)
- Node placement effects via clustering-based analysis

We propose a two-stage clustering method that reveals hidden spatial imbalance in node usage and its influence on power efficiency.

## Key Contributions

- **C1**: Temporal variability analysis (month, day of week, time-of-day)
- **C2**: Node architecture and allocation scale-based power variability
- **C3**: Application-specific and user-level configuration impacts
- **C4**: Cluster-based analysis revealing spatial power variability across node ranges
